# LeanLean website

The website of the LeanLean benchmark: <https://leanleanbench.com/>

It shows the leaderboard and, for every model and repository, what the agent changed:
a dependency graph, a code diff, and the agent's full trace.

## Run it locally

```bash
python3 serve.py 8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>. The site is plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript in `site/`,
with its data already built in `site/data/`.
